Requirement
-Write a program that stores below information with proper data types and output all variables with ONLY one console.log() statement.

	favColor = Blue
	favNumber = 7

Expected output: 
The favorite book is JS Algorithms & Data Structures 
The favorite color is Blue
The favorite number is 7

/*Task4:
Requirement:
Write a program that generates 5 random numbers between 
1 to 10 (1 and 10 are included)
Calculate some points based on numbers generated. So, the 
points will be calculated as below
1st  number will be multiplied by 5 and added as points
2nd number will be multiplied by 4 and added as points
3rd number will be multiplied by 3 and added as points
4th number will be multiplied by 2 and added as points
5th number will be multiplied by 1 and added as points

Test data:
3 7 2 1 8
Expected result:
59
