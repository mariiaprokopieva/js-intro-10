Hoisting: using functions and variables before they are declared

Function declarations will be hoisted
Arrow functions and function expressions are not hoisted, you can not use thi before their initialization

var is hoisted, let and const are not hoisted
var-let-const respect the global and function scope
let and const also respect the block scope while var does not support block scope
