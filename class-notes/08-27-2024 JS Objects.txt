RECAP:

Object: reference data type and store data in key-value pairs
Object properties are not index based.
Object properties can be accessed, updated, deleted using the keys.


*** keys are by default strings and UNIQUE!!!
*** values can be of any type and duplicates.


const obj1 = {};
const obj2 = new Object();

// creating a property
obj2.name = 'afadf';

// updating a property
obj2.name = 'afadfdfdf';

// deleting a property
delete obj2.name;

Built-in Object static method
Object.keys() -> takes an object variable as an argument and returns all the keys as an array
Object.values() -> takes an object variable as an argument and returns all the values as an array
Object.entries() -> takes an object variable as an argument and returns all the key-values as a nested array
