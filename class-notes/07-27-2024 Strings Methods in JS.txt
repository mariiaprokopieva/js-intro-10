STATIC vs NON-STATIC methods:
- static methods are invoked with the Object/Class/Blueprint template
- non-static methods are invoked with the instance of the Object/Class/Blueprint template

Math.max(5, 3); // static method
Number.isInteger(5); // static method

those two are called with their parent object


let n1 = 25.55408;

n1.toFixed(2); // 25.55

NON-STATIC: invoking function with data
