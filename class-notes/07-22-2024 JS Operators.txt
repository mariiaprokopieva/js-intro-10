Recap:

assignment, arithmetic calculations, comparison, logical

Comparison 

let x = 5

All comparison operators return boolean (true or false)

LOGICAL OPERATORS 

&& logical and
|| logical or
! logical not

3 > 1 && 1 > 10     false
valid username && valid password        true

true && true    true
true && false   false
false && true   false
false && false  false


1 === 1 || !false   true 
2 == 3 || 5 < 10    true
1 == 1 || 2 < 3     true
1 != 1 || 2 > 5     false

Falsy
0
''      -> empty string
false
null
undefined
NaN

Any other values are truthy


Two types of languages: 
    Compiled: C, C++, Java, C#
    Strict, more syntax rules

    Interpreted: JavaSkript
    It is more flexible and evaluates expressions more like a human brain

NOT OPERATOR    !

!false      -> true
!true       -> false

NULLISH COALESCING OPERATOR (??)

JS has a built in Number object which has many useful properties and functions

properties: information about the object (what it has)
functions: behaviors of the object (what it does)
