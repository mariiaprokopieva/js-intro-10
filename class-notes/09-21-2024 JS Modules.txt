1. Common JS Modules
module.exports and require()

2. ES6 Modules
export and import: supported by all the browsers

Both of them are used a lot, 50/50

HOW TO RUN JS CODE?
-NodeJS
-Browser
-Extensions (you'll never use this in work environment)

Static methods and properties can be accessed with the className, while non-static properties and methods can be accessed with the object of the class
class Apple {
    static propertyA = 'Hi';
    propertyB = 'Hello';

    static funcA() {
        console.log('I am static');
    }

    funcB() {
        console.log('I am NOT static');
    }
}

// Accessing static properties and methods
Apple.propertyA; // 'Hi'
Apple.funcA(); // 'I am static'

const a1 = new Apple();
a1.funcB(); // 'I am NOT static'


If the method executes the same task for every single object of the class, it makes sense to use static method.

class Batch10Student {
    constructor(fullname, age) {
        this.fullname = fullname;
        this.age = age;
    }

    getProgramName() {
        return 'SDET';
    }

    static getFullName() {
        return this.fullname;
    }

    const Bermet = new Batch10Student('Bermet S', 20);

    bermet.getFullname();
}

class AppleStore {
    constructor(id, city, state, zip) {
        this.id = id;
        this.city = city;
        this.state = state;
        this.zip = zip;
    }

    static getIphone16ProMaxPrice() {
        
    }


}



HTML - HyperText MarkUp Language
It is not a programming language because you cannot create functions with it.


Web Application: anything you visit on a browser is a web application
Mobile Application: any application on your phone from App Store or Google Play
Hybrid Application: You can use on web and install on your mobile devices

Desktop Application: Robot Framework (Python) - testing

Web Application: consists of many web-pages

home page/dashboard/landing page

Every time url changes, you are on a new page

Each web page is created using HTML
Whether it's a button, image, paragraph - they're all web elements

How do you represent an element of the web-page?

Each web element is represented by an HTML tag
<p></p>
<img/>
<div></div>

<button>Apply Now</button>

Opening tag: <button>
Closing tag: </button>
Opening and closing tag / self closing tag: <img/>

Every tag has a lot of attributes

Tags may have many properties/attributes
<tagName>VISIBLE TEXT</tagName>

Attributes are added as key-value pairs to the opening tag.

<tagName attr1="value1" attr2="value2">TEXT</tagName>
