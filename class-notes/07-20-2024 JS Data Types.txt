Recap:

Output statements: console.log()
This is a pre-built method used to output some data, text to console for debugging purposes.

Debugging: troubleshooting  the program to find issues, logic errors Execute

Escape sequences

With ES6, JS added backticks ` that provide Template Literals


DATA TYPES:

Primitive types: basic types that usually stores a piece of information
7 primitives:
string: text
number: number
BigInt
Boolean: true | false



reference types: complex types which can store more information
arrays, objects, maps...

1. String: a sequence of characters (zero, one or multiple characters)
''      -> empty string
' '     -> string
'123'   -> string

2. Number:
Whole number = absolute number: 1, 2, 10, 25, 100, 1000
Decimal number = floating number: 2.5, 10.99, ...

byte: -128, 127
short: 2 bytes
int: 4 bytes
long: 8 bytes

float: 4 bytes up to 15-16 precision

in JS number is used to store all absolute and decimal numbers (8 bytes)

3. BigInt: used to store larger numbers (more than 8 bytes)


4. Boolean

= vs == vs ===

=   assignment operator
==  comparison operator (loose)
=== comparison operator (strict)

3 == 3      -> true
3 == '3'    -> true (checks the value only, not the data type )
3 === '3'   -> false (checks both the value and data type)

'5' === 'five'  -> false

Deprecation

UNDEFINED VS NULL

undefined is the default type when you declare a variable but do not provide value
null is specifically stating that this variable holds no value. Absence of information.


let name = 'Data'

Object data type is used to store key-value pairs, properties

firstName => 'John'
lastName => 'Doe'
age => 25
phoneNumber => '000-000-0000'
email => 'johndoe@gmail.com'
password => 'john1234'
