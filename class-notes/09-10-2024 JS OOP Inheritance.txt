JS Protopypes or Classes are used to improve the reusability of the objects

Prototype or class = template from which you can create many objects
Objects or instances are created from prototypes or classes using constructor together with new keyword

Inheritance: it is building a parent-child relationship between 2 classes or prototypes.
In this case, child class or prototype will be able to use all (not private) parent members(functions, properties, constructor)

How do we achieve inheritance?
we use extends keyword

What is method overriding?
When child class inheriting parent class but changes the method body.

What is method overloading?
When you are able to use a method with different arguments




super() is used to inherit parent constructor to child constructor
