Every coding statement finishes with semicolon ;

In JS even if you don't put semicolon the code will run, but it's better to put it

Code: Source code: a code, written with programming language

Execute: run the code
Compile: check the code for errors
to compile: check for syntax errors

Statement: any line of code (in any programming language)
Comments: are used for 

/** automatically puts comments for multiline comments
used for documentation 

Use backslash for escape sequence 

\"
\'


Variables:
- is a special container that stores a value

let - can be reassigned with new value
var - can be reassigned with new value
const - can not be reassigned with new value

INTERVIEW QUESTION

//Another difference bt let and const

let city = 'Chicago'; //variable initialization = declare a variable and assign value

let country; // declaring a variable or variable declaration
country = US; // value assignment to a variable

const firstMonth = 'January'; //const must always be initialized

const cannot be declared without a value

data types:
string: is a text data type which can be stored in variables using single or double quotes
number: is number data which can be stored in variables without quotes

5 + 5 = 10
'5' + '5' = '55'

Concatenation: combining multiple strings with operator +

'5' + 3 = '53'



Variable Naming: how  should we name our variables?

Convention: not written rule, but followed by all the programmers
