constructor: it is a special method o function used to create objects of the prototype/class

- An ES6 class can have only one constructor
- If we do not create a custom constructor, JavaScript will provide us the default constractor


Class members: properties, constructors, functions

INHERITANCE: common concept used in all programming languages
It increases code reusability by child classed from parent classes
Public properties, functions and constructors of the pareant classes can be iherited
Private properties and functions in parent classes cannot be inherited
Parent cannot inherit from child
one child class can have ONLY one parent
one parent class can have multiple child classes

class A extends B {

}

class C extends A {
    
}

A is the child class
B is the parent class
