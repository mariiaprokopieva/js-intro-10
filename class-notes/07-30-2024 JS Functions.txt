Function: is a block of code we can execute for a task
It icreases reusability of the code

{} -> block

POINTS to consider when creating a function:
1. Task - what it does
2. Give it a meaningful name
3. Parameters/arguments
4. Return type vs void - what it returns if it is a return type method
5. Static or non-static
