1. for loop:
initialization
condition
update - change


Infinite loop: a loop never terminates

for(let i = 10; i > 1; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}

for ( ; ; ) {
    console.log('Hello');
} 
this is also infinite loop

2. While loop

while(condition) {
    // block of code to execute
}

let written = 1;
let guess = undefined;


while(guess !== written) {
    guess =getRandomNumber(1,10);
}

console.log('Numbers finally matched!');


for loop        -> 50-60% of the time
for...of loop   -> 30-40% of the time
while loop      -> 5-10% of the time
do...while and for...in loop -> 1-2% of the time


for loop        vs      while loop

Do I know how many times this loop exactly run?

    YES                     NO
for loop                while loop


3. Do while loop


let i = 5;

while (i < 10) {                
    console.log(i);
    i++;
}



do {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
}
while (i > 10)


4. for...of loop
Mostly used with iterable objects like arrays
