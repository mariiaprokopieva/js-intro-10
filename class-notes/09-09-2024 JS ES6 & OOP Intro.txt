let vs const

similarities
    - ES6 features
    - used to declare variables
    - they can't be hoisted. var is hoisted (declaration moved to the top)
    - noth respect function and block scope. var does not respect block scope

differences
    - let allows variables to ve reassigned, but const does not.
    - const usually used with reference types whie let is used with primitives (not all the time)
    - let can be declared without initialization, but const MUST be initialized
    - const is used dor constants that you will never reassign after their initialization

    const variableName; // Error
    const variableName = 5; // MUST be initialized

    let variableName; // undefined

***INTERVIEW QUESTION***
    Compiler time errors: these are the errors you see before running the program
    Runtime errors: these are the errors you see after running the program


spread operator: spreads the array elements or object properties into their individual elements
rest parameters: is going to collect given arguments in an array
