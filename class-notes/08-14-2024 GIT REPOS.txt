GIT: Global Information Tracker
    We use GIT to push our codes to remote repos and collaborate with other team members or developers/QAs/programmers

GIT is a VCS (Version Control System)
GIT is a distributed version control System

centralized VCS: we do not prefer this as if server is down or there is no network, we can't push our changes
distributed VCS: we have a local copy of the server repo and can keep working even though there are issues with server or network

GitHub / GitLab / Bitbucket / Azure DevOps: All hosting tools/apps where we can store our remote repos

SSH: Special type of authentication used instead of username and password


HOW TO CLONE AN EXISTING REMOTE REPO TO YOUR LOCAL 
1. Create a new remote repository
2. Clone it to your local (BUT make sure you are on the correct path)


Branch commands:
git branch  -> list the existing branches.
•git branch <branch-name> -> create a new branch with the specified name.
•git checkout <branch-name>  -> switch to the specified branch
•git checkout -b <branch-name>  -> create and switch to the created branch.
•git branch –d <branch-name>  -> delete the specified branch
