Synchronous vs Asynchronous

- JS is asynchronous in its nature.
- Synchronous: the code reads in order top to bottom with no issues.
- Asynchronous: tasks are executed simulaneously (at the same time or concurrently)

connectToDB(); // 3 seconds
fetchData(); // 2 seconds
useData(); // 0.5 seconds

3 ways to resolve asynchronous nature of the codes - tasks
1. callbacks
2. promises
3. async-await (syntatical syntax on top of promises)

Promises:
- ES6 feature
- Promise stages: pending, fulfilled, rejected
- then() and catch()



TEST CASE:
1. Go to https://www.amazon.com/    1 second
2. Select a product 2 seconds
3. Add to cart  0.5 second
4. Checkout 1 second
